# Number-Path

The code provides a verification of my method and the expression by simulating with randomness. The user can decide which number to land on and how many times they want to run the simulation. The error between the simulation result and result from expression is given. More times user simulates, higher accuracy (lower error) the user gets. 

The second part is a graph from N=2 to N=25, corresponding to the probabiity.
